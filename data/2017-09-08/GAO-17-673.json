These systems convert heat generated by the natural decay of plutonium 238 (Pu-238), a scarce resource, into electricity. In 2015, the Department of Energy produced new Pu-238 for the first time since 1988. However, this process is highly technical and the...", "title": "Space Exploration: DOE Could Improve Planning and Communication Related to Plutonium-238 and Radioisotope Power Systems Production Challenges", "topics": ["Program evaluation", "Program management", "Solar energy", "Source selection", "Power generation", "Use of funds", "Fuels", "Electric power generation", "Solar system", "Space", "Space exploration", "Internal controls", "Risk management", "Technology"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-17-673", "versions": [{"title": "Highlights Page (1 page)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-673-highlights.pdf"}, {"title": "Full Report (53 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-673.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (61 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688254.pdf"}]}

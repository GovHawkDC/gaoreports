By revealing the genetic codes of pathogens, it can allow researchers to develop targeted vaccines, track new variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, and more. Newer sequencing technologies are faster and more affordable. But widespread use for disease surveillance would require more laboratories to have infrastructure such as computer...", "title": "Science & Tech Spotlight: Genomic Sequencing Of Infectious Pathogens", "topics": ["Infectious diseases", "Disease control", "Science and technology", "Vaccinations", "Genetics", "Epidemics", "Microbiology", "Antibiotic-resistance", "Data quality", "Privacy", "Public health", "Pathogens", "Science and Technology", "Deoxyribonucleic acid"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-426sp", "versions": [{"title": "Full Report (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-426sp.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/720/713540.pdf"}]}

Most irrigation is in the West, where water is relatively scarce and precipitation low. The 3 main irrigation technologies\u2014gravity, sprinkler, and micro\u2014can all be modified to be more efficient and save water. But in practice, farms may use such water savings to increase yield, switch to thirstier crops, or irrigate more land.

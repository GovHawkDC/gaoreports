Swarms could range from a few drones to possibly thousands. Advances in artificial intelligence and drone components have made swarms possible\u2014even if they're limited to simpler missions like aerial light shows for now. As the technology improves, it could be used to...", "title": "Science & Tech Spotlight: Drone Swarm Technologies", "topics": ["Cybersecurity", "Robotics", "Science and technology", "Technology assessment", "Wildfires", "Unmanned aerial systems", "Drones", "Privacy", "Emergency management", "Science and Technology", "Science and technology issues", "Artificial intelligence"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106930", "versions": [{"title": "Full Report (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106930.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/870/861345.pdf"}]}

While current encryption methods are nearly impossible for normal computers to break, quantum computers could quickly and easily break certain encryptions and put data at risk. This spotlight looks at how to better secure data before quantum computers capable of breaking those encryption methods are ready in possibly 10-20 years...", "title": "Science & Tech Spotlight: Securing Data for a Post-Quantum World", "topics": ["National security", "Science and technology", "Technology assessment", "Sensitive data", "Computers", "Information sharing", "Personally identifiable information", "Science and Technology", "Electronic signatures", "Federal agencies", "Information security"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106559", "versions": [{"title": "Full Report (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106559.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/820/817959.pdf"}]}

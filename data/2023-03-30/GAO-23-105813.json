A 2022 experiment achieved a key milestone on the path to viable fusion energy: it was the first experiment in which the fusion reaction produced more energy than the energy injected into it. However, this technology faces challenges before it can produce commercial electricity. For example, new materials will need to be developed...", "title": "Fusion Energy: Potentially Transformative Technology Still Faces Fundamental Challenges", "topics": ["Energy technology", "Energy", "Research and development", "Engineering", "Power plants", "Technology assessment", "Energy resources", "Energy development", "Fusion energy", "Nuclear energy", "Laws and regulations"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105813", "versions": [{"title": "Highlights Page (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105813-highlights.pdf"}, {"title": "Full Report (52 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105813.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (58 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/820/818582.pdf"}]}

These weapons can produce force that ranges from deterrent, to damaging, to destructive. Many countries, including the U.S., are researching their use. Because they use energy instead of bullets or missiles, directed energy weapons could be less expensive per shot and have virtually unlimited firing power. However, the long-term health effects of these...", "title": "Science & Tech Spotlight: Directed Energy Weapons", "topics": ["Weapons", "Science and technology", "Research and development", "Technology assessment", "Military forces", "Technological innovations", "Unmanned aerial systems", "Missiles", "Science and technology issues", "Electronics", "National Defense"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106717", "versions": [{"title": "Full Report (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106717.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/830/825926.pdf"}]}

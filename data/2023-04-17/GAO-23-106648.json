For example, integrating spider DNA makes a silkworm produce super strong, ultra-lightweight silk. The technology could help address challenges in areas such as medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, and the environment. This Science & Tech Spotlight describes some of the benefits of synthetic biology and the challenges...", "title": "Science & Tech Spotlight: Synthetic Biology", "topics": ["Science and technology", "Engineering", "Technology assessment", "Scientists", "Genetics", "Biology", "Medicine", "Science and Technology", "Biotechnology", "Diseases", "Deoxyribonucleic acid"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106648", "versions": [{"title": "Full Report (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-106648.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/820/819138.pdf"}]}

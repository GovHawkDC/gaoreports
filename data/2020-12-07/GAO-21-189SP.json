But the networks have shortcomings such as trouble detecting localized pollution. Technological improvements have led to smaller, more affordable air quality sensors and better satellite-based sensors. These can help close gaps in pollution monitoring and research. For example, through more dense and widespread monitoring, these sensors may help pinpoint air pollution sources...", "title": "Science & Tech Spotlight: Air Quality Sensors", "topics": ["Pollutants", "Air quality management", "Health effects", "Public health research", "Satellites", "Air pollution control", "Particulate matter", "Clean air", "Air pollution", "Science and Technology", "Ozone", "Public health", "Air quality", "Air quality standards"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-189sp", "versions": [{"title": "Full Report (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-189sp.pdf"}]}

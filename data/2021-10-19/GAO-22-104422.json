This report assesses the potential of these technologies, their benefits and risks, and policy options that could help foster their development. For example, future quantum computers could outperform regular computers in simulating chemical interactions, potentially reducing drug development time. Some small, error-prone quantum computers are...", "title": "Quantum Computing and Communications: Status and Prospects", "topics": ["Physics", "Science and technology", "Communications", "Internet", "Information science", "Technology development", "Computers", "Software", "Research and development", "Engineering", "Science and Technology", "Computer network protocols"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104422", "versions": [{"title": "Highlights Page (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-104422-highlights.pdf"}, {"title": "Full Report (62 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-104422.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (62 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/720/717172.pdf"}]}

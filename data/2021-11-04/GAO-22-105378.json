Most electricity-generating solar cells are made with crystalline silicon in a process that is complex, expensive, and energy-intensive. Alternative materials may perform better and be easier and cheaper to make. Some absorb light 10-100 times more efficiently using thin films. In addition, these cells can be manufactured quickly and easily, reducing cost. Some alternative materials remain in the...", "title": "Science and Tech Spotlight: Alternative Materials for Solar Cells", "topics": ["Science and technology", "Energy efficiency", "Electricity", "Renewable energy sources", "Energy information", "Solar energy", "Alternative energy sources", "Technology assessment", "Solar radiation", "Manufacturing", "Science and Technology"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105378", "versions": [{"title": "Full Report (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-105378.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/720/717389.pdf"}]}

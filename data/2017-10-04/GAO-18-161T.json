These systems convert heat generated by the plutonium 238 (Pu-238), a scarce resource, into electricity. In 2015, the Department of Energy produced new Pu-238 for the first time since 1988. However, this process is highly technical and the department faces challenges...", "title": "Space Exploration: Improved Planning and Communication Needed for Plutonium-238 and Radioisotope Power Systems Production", "topics": ["Energy resources", "Electric power generation", "Energy supplies", "Plutonium", "Solar systems", "Space", "Space exploration", "Radioactive isotopes", "Internal controls", "Energy", "Isotopes"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-161t", "versions": [{"title": "Full Report (14 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-18-161t.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (16 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688634.pdf"}]}

These technologies build on the study of the smallest particles of energy and matter to collect, generate, and process information in ways existing technologies can\u2019t. For example, quantum sensors may be able to locate stealth targets or determine an object\u2019s location and speed without GPS. Quantum computers may dramatically accelerate computing for some applications, such as decrypting...", "title": "Science & Tech Spotlight: Quantum Technologies", "topics": ["Information technology", "Computer science", "Fiber optics", "Science and technology", "Classified information", "National security", "Technology development", "Physics", "Communications", "Computers", "Science and Technology"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-527sp", "versions": [{"title": "Full Report (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-527sp.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/707271.pdf"}]}

For example, it could help people with paralysis regain control of their limbs and enable servicemembers to operate a drone hands-free on the battlefield. Yet, creating a direct connection between brain and machine may raise concerns. For example, it could give users unfair advantages...", "title": "Science & Tech Spotlight: Brain-Computer Interfaces", "topics": ["Unmanned aerial systems", "Technology assessment", "Science and technology issues", "Science and technology", "Hackers", "Science and Technology", "Clinical trials", "People with disabilities", "Prosthetic devices", "Paralysis", "Privacy"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-106118", "versions": [{"title": "Full Report (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-106118.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (2 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/730/722396.pdf"}]}

We looked at some technologies intended to protect the U.S. electrical grid from possible effects of these disturbances. Technologies being tested include: systems that block currents from geomagnetic disturbances power transformers designed to be more resistant to such currents The government has taken some steps...", "title": "Critical Infrastructure Protection: Protecting the Electric Grid from Geomagnetic Disturbances", "topics": ["Electricity grids", "Electric power", "Storms", "Critical infrastructure", "Magnetic fields", "Electric power transmission", "Atmosphere", "Critical infrastructure protection", "Technology assessment", "Electric utilities", "Energy"], "type": "reports-testimonies", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-19-98", "versions": [{"title": "Highlights Page (1 page)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-98-highlights.pdf"}, {"title": "Full Report (55 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-98.pdf"}, {"title": "Accessible PDF (56 pages)", "url": "https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/696284.pdf"}]}
